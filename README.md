# How to Contribute

## General Rules

- Be a good person
- Add GIFs that can be used in the context of shipping code reviews, design reviews or just any "Looks good to me" or "Ship it!" moments
- You can add as many as you'd like
- Use GIFs at a reasonable size, no more than 5MB.
- GIFs should come from one of the approved domains in [domains.json](domains.json)
- GIFs need to pass all tests and be approved in a Pull Request.
- Keep names all lowercase, the only special character that is allowed is a dash `-`.
- Include all fields: `_id`, `name`, `url`, `description`, `active`.
- Don't remove or rename any previously submitted GIFs as they could be used in the wild already.
- If a GIF is broken, mark the active state to 0 or fix the URL.
